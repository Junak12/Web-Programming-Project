This project is a fitness-focused web application that provides users with various features to enhance their wellness journey. The application has been built using modern web technologies, including React for the frontend and various essential libraries and components for an interactive user experience.

## Frontend

The frontend of the application is developed with **React.js** and follows a component-based architecture, making it modular and easy to maintain. The project is structured as follows:

### Components:
- **Navbar:** A responsive navigation bar to allow users to easily navigate between sections.
- **Hero:** A prominent section showcasing the website's key message and offering users a quick overview.
- **Workout Sessions:** Displays available workout sessions and related information.
- **Gallery:** Showcases images or videos related to fitness and workouts.
- **Pricing:** Displays the pricing for different workout or wellness plans.
- **Contact:** A form or contact section for users to reach out for more information.
- **BMICalculator:** An interactive feature allowing users to calculate their BMI (Body Mass Index).
- **Nutrition And Wellness:** A section providing tips and resources related to nutrition and general wellness.
- **Footer:** Contains additional links and information like social media handles, terms, and privacy policies.

### Libraries and Tools Used:
- **React Router:** Used for navigating between different components of the application (pages).
- **React Toastify:** Provides a simple way to display notifications for user interactions (e.g., success or error messages).
- **CSS Modules:** For styling components, ensuring that each component's styles are scoped locally to avoid global styles conflicts.

## Backend

- While the current project focuses on the frontend, the backend would typically involve handling API requests for user data, workout sessions, pricing, and other dynamic content.
- The backend can be developed using various technologies, such as **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and a database like **MongoDB** or **MySQL** for storing user information and workout details.
